            <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <p>How do you do, fellow nerd? Thanks for stopping by. I'll assume you've happened upon my humble fortress of solitude after hearing tales from your peers of the mythical design &amp; development unicorn. We are a surprisingly uncommon breed that have more practical applications than our rarity would suggest. A fitting addition to any party's forthcoming adventure.</p>
            <p>Given you've come this far, the only practical next step is to combine efforts and make the internet even cooler than it already claims to be. So carry on my intrepid companion, this is gonna be great.</p>

                <h3>My Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p>History would suggest that product designers usually aren't capable of supporting development efforts through code once merge requests start to take flight. Meanwhile, engineers don't often find themselves with extra time to obsess over things like type scales and font weights.</p>
                <p>That's where I fit into the equation. I've built my career around being the exception to both ideals. I find great solace between the two specialties, with the knowledge and ability to bridge that illustrious gap. Here's what you can expect on day one.</p>

                        <h4>Design Debonair</h4>
                        <p>The world deserves beautiful and well thought out experiences. From niche SaaS apps to major financial media outlets that reach millions; my 16 year tenure designing across the web has been privy to it all.</p>

                        <h4>Markup Magician</h4>
                        <p>The ability to write beautifully semantic, production ready HTML & CSS is something I enjoy and take pride in. Best yet, this frees up your full-stack engineers to do the work they actually want to do.</p>

                        <h4>Figma Fanboy</h4>
                        <p>You're only as good as tools you use and I know design's newest kid on the block like the back of my hand. This means less time finagling with brushes and more time throwing paint at the canvas.</p>

                        <h4>Systems Savant</h4>
                        <p>Our work thrives off finding patterns and making them reusable. With a history building design systems, my contributions have sped-up development time while enhancing user experiences as a result.</p>

                            <h4>A11y Advocate</h4>
                            <p>Accessible code is good code. In the past, I've lead efforts to update existing products to meet ADA compliance; all while provoking new policies that align with the latest WCAG guidelines.</p>

                        <h4>Responsive Rockstar</h4>
                        <p>With recent advancements in CSS, you shouldn't have to write your markup more than once. Abiding by this mindset, I've helped reduce technical overhead by removing the need for mobile specificity.</p>

                <p>As the design and front-end development lead, we set to rebuild the whole site from the ground up. Legacy technology stacks were successfully sunset in the process while each corner of the overall aesthetic and experience was given a well deserved modern facelift.</p>

                <h3>Mobile Web CRM Proof of Concept</h3>
                <p>With this project, I was tasked with creating a working mobile web concept of our core CRM product to illustrate the benefits and drawbacks of responsive web solution when compared against an equilvalent native app. In total I had two weeks to design and develop a working prototype that was then presented to executive leadership.</p>
                <p>This exercise remains one of the largest accomplishments in my time at Total Expert thus far. In the end, the decision ultimately favored hiring a third party vendor to develop a native Android and iOS application. However, this proved that with minimal effort and resources it is possible to reengineer the designs and codebase of our existing platform to offer a more expansive mobile web solution. An initative that has already found footing in future planning.</p>

                <h3>Native Mobile App (iOS &amp; Android)</h3>
                <p>With a business direction decided upon and a development vendor selected, it was time to get to work. Given an aggressive timeframe of only 14 weeks to find ourselves in the app stores, we didn't have the same exploritative luxuries normally alloted for such an elaborant undertaking. Project deadlines like these force intiuition that comes only with experience and after only 3 weeks, we delivered a fully realized page architecture and corresponding designs.</p>

                <h3>The Mosby Design System</h3>
                <p>Given past experiences with systems work at Dow Jones, one of my first tasks at Total Expert was to migrate the current library of application assets from Sketch over to Figma. Given the ehancements to component architecture that the latter supports, this required building components from the ground up. This also allowed us to refine the markup and styles that support each of these components along the way.</p>

            <p>It's a necessary evil to outline all the possible edge cases that a particular component like the multi-select dropdown can offer. In this case the multi-select dropdown can be presented in one of nine different ways. My responsibility with the design system was to ensure all nine of those deviations all presented themselves to the end user in the same manner on screen.</p>

                    <h4>Documentation</h4>
                    <p>Nobody wakes up in the morning excited to write documentation, but an accessible style guide is an important asset when creating any system. These guidelines allow for flexible usage given the circumstance while still feeling like part of a larger, more cohesive whole. Visual aids for what should and shouldn't be done for each situation aids in the understanding of how best to incorporate items.</p>

            <p>The struggle became understanding the threshold for what should and shouldn't be editable for each individual asset. Nothing illustrates that idea more than the behemoth that is a data table component and the variety of information that can be presented in each indivdiual cell.</p>

                <h3>Wedding Websites Don't Have To Suck</h3>
                <p>When your significant other happens to be a world-class designer and tells you that the plan is to design everything for your forthcoming nuptials from the ground up; you best deliver a website that will withstand the test of time. Nearly a decade later and I would argue that this collection of code did just that.</p>

                <p>At the time, it seemed like a fool's errand to create the entire site as an uncompromising desktop experience whilst having responsiveness in mind, all from one codebase.

                <p>And here's how the page broke down on mobile for reference in those circumstances where you found yourself standing next to a cow in a barren field at 2:23 with a ceremony set to start in 7 minutes. </p>

                <p>Every good design starts with an origin. In all cases, I enjoy creating a project's moodboard almost as much as I enjoy actual design process itself.
